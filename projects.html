      On a global scale we expect the energy budget of a planet to be set by its orbit, including the semi-major axis and eccentricity, as well as its rotation, including the spin rate and tilt angle. These combine to set the periodic variation in the planet's sub-stellar point in latitude and longitude.

      This work builds on my project on <a href="#thermal">reassessing thermal phase curves</a>. We incorporate the geometry of a freely-varying rotation axis to examine the geometric effect of a planet's high tilt angle on its thermal phase curves. Both the tilt magnitude and orientation with respect to the observer can have first-order effects on empirical parameters such as the amplitude and phase offset. We are exploring whether the shapes of known planets' photometry lend themselves to this interpretation.

      We explore whether the interaction between orbital eccentricity, which forces variations in heating from the star, and rotation rate, would produce observable differences in phase photometry for Earth-sized aquaplanets. Slower rotation tends to distribute the heating less evenly in longitude, creating different surface patterns of ocean and ice cover.

      Observables will ultimately come from upper layers of the atmosphere, rather than surface conditions, so can surface features propagate upward? We construct "water colors", or differences in fluxes between bands that differ in their sensitivity to water-based absorption features. Depending on the viewing geometry and observable contrast, differences in the scale of rotation rate can propagate to differences in eclipse and transit depths.

      The thermal phase variations of exoplanets should tell us about how they respond to the heating from their host stars. At the time of our publication, 13 planets had phase photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope's IRAC instrument.

      In principle the shape of these variations will be set not only by the motion of the planet of the orbit but also the bulk rotation, as well as more finely by the composition and structure of the atmosphere; multi-wavelength observations should probe different layers of the atmosphere.

We used a simple thermal model in an attempt to fit the broadest features of each phase curve. In most cases, given the precision of the available data, the thermal approach reproduces the major variations at comparable efficacy with more sophisticated physical models. Regardless of the model used, it continues to be important to accurately characterize the instrumental response, especially so with the eventual launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.

      At San Francisco State University I completed my master's thesis in physics with Dr. <a href="http://astro.ucr.edu/members/faculty/kane/">Stephen Kane</a>; this project was the publication that resulted from this work. We examined whether transiting planets known to be in the habitable zones of their host stars differed as a population in their system properties from the population of transiting planets as a whole.
