      We couple our forward models with an MCMC routine to fit a high-resolution, ground-based emission spectrum (see Daemgen et al. 2017), and ultimately measure its carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio. This ratio is key to understanding how and when HD 106906 b formed in its system. We can therefore help to disambiguate the formation pathways of companions such as HD 106906 b as either brown dwarfs or planets.

      Mapping here refers to recovering the map, or spatial distribution, of the brightness of a planet across its visible surface. This is often done for planets which transit across their host stars, and are eclipsed as they subsequently pass behind their stars. The major challenge is that currently we cannot directly resolve these planets, which means we may only measure a 1-dimensional time series of the combined brightnesses of the planet and star.

      Earth's surface topography counts very few points on land "antipodal" (opposite on the globe) to other points on land. Moreover, this “antipodal anticorrelation” has been a feature of the globe at least since the break-up of Pangaea, Earth's most recent supercontinent.

      This hypothesis gains support from published work that links the plate structure and size distribution to the dynamics of mantle convection and its influence on the lithosphere, and shows preferences for a specific parity in surface harmonic structure. We corroborate this with our own fully-3D models of mantle convection.

      Combining these spectral analyses with a simple model of erosion and volcanism, we are also able to estimate &mdash; if Venus also had active plate tectonics at some point in its history &mdash; how long it has been in its current stagnant lid state. Our analysis estimates this transition occurred roughly 600 million years ago. In the context of future exoplanetary characterization, if active plate tectonics are a potential requirement of planetary habitability, antipodal anticorrelation may constitute an important observable clue.

      With the help of my thesis advisor Prof. Greg Laughlin, and fellow astronomer Dr. Sarah Millholland, we have also developed an underlying dynamical hypothesis which may allow planets to maintain high tilts, via spin-orbit resonances. The close-in giant planet CoRoT-2 b currently offers the tightest constraints under our obliquity hypothesis, and as a testable prediction implies the existence of a non-transiting outer companion, which can be searched for in radial velocity variations.

      We explore whether the interaction between orbital eccentricity, which forces variations in heating from the star, and rotation rate, would produce observable differences in phase photometry for Earth-sized aquaplanets. Slower rotation tends to distribute the heating less evenly in longitude, creating different surface patterns of ocean and ice cover.

      Observables will ultimately come from upper layers of the atmosphere, rather than surface conditions, so can surface features propagate upward? We construct "water colors", or differences in fluxes between bands that differ in their sensitivity to water-based absorption features. Depending on the viewing geometry and observable contrast, differences in the scale of rotation rate can propagate to differences in phase variations, as well as eclipse and transit depths.

We used a simple thermal model in an attempt to fit the broadest features of each phase curve. In most cases, given the precision of the available data, the thermal approach reproduces the major variations at comparable efficacy with more sophisticated physical models.
