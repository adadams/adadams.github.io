  I'm a postdoctoral astronomer working with Professor Michael Meyer's research group in the astronomy department at the University of Michigan. I'm primarily interested in characterizing exoplanets, especially their atmospheres, and broader questions in astrobiology. My PhD projects at Yale University explored the theoretical modeling of exoplanet atmospheres, using anything from simple radiative models to sophisticated global climate models.

  I studied physics and music at Brown University as an undergrad, and then went on to San Francisco State University, where I worked with Prof. Stephen Kane for my master's thesis. (For more details please see my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u58bWk6t1qIbjWpSCPsvHzwYsT8F4Oza/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CV</a>.)

      Beyond astronomy I really enjoy playing, composing, and improvising for the piano. I also enjoy swimming and solving twisty puzzles, the most common of which is the Rubik's Cube, and I'm an active <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2006ADAM01" target="_blank">member</a> of the World Cube Association.
