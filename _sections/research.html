      My research centers on learning more about the atmospheres of planets outside our Solar System by observing their phases as they orbit their host stars. Their thermal profile translates to these phases and tells us about how these planets respond to the heating from the stars.

      This response depends on the atmosphere itself, like what it's composed of and the pressure and thickness, but globally the rotation and orbit are going to have primary effects on how the starlight gets distributed over the planet. We can learn the shape and size of the orbit, but the rotation is still a major challenge.

      Right now we're mostly limited to observing these phases for giant planets on super-short orbits, where we can both detect the phases and get a full orbit in just a couple of days. The interplay between their days (set by the rotation) and their years (set by the orbits) is especially important for these planets.
